      The game takes place in a company IT department. Management is organizing a hackathon on the Green IT theme.
      Two development teams are competing to be the most efficient team.
      Release the required applications before the opponent team to have more points, but respect the Green IT requirements or you'll get drowned in the Technical Debt.

    <div class="statement-rules-content">
      <p>Each player has an IT development team. The game takes place in an office with 8 desks.
      The hackathon will last many turns. Each turn, the players will play one after the other.
      </p>
      <p>This game is based on <strong>Deck Building</strong>. Each team will have its own deck of cards that will get bigger during the game.
      <p>Each team starts the game with <const>4</const> <strong>BONUS skill</strong> cards and <const>4</const> <strong>Technical Debt</strong> cards. Those cards will be their personal draw pile. And their personal discard pile will be reshuffled into the draw pile when it gets empty.</p>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/master/config/Tuto_DeckBuilding.png" alt="Deckbuilding: the player discard pile is reshuffled to create the player's draw pile" />
      <br>The team will get more cards and will lose some during the game.

      </h3>
      <p>
        The office is made of 8 desks. Each desk is dedicated to a specific skill
       <ul style="padding-left: 20px;padding-bottom: 0">
       <li><p>

        <p>Those desks are numbered from <const>0</const> to <const>7</const>. Each of those desks contains <const>5</const> <strong>skill</strong> cards at the beginning of the game.

      <h3 style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1;">Applications
      </h3>
      <p>
        Each application needs some skills to be released. Applications are the same for both players. Once an application has been released, it is removed from the game for both players. </p>
        <p>Applications will get bigger through the leagues.</p>
        <p>A small application needs 3 sets of 2 skills (like 2 <strong>REFACTORING</strong>, 2 <strong>TRAINING</strong> and 2 <strong>CODING</strong>)</p>
        <p>A big application needs 2 sets of 4 skills (like 4 <strong>DAILY_ROUTINE</strong> and 4 <strong>CODE_REVIEW</strong>)</p>
        <p>Each <strong>BONUS skill</strong> card provides one good skill (any of them) and one shoddy skill.</p>
        <p>Each specific <strong>skill</strong> card provides 2 good skills (of this specific type) and 2 shoddy skills.</p>
        <p>For instance, a <strong>CODING</strong> card provides 2 <strong>CODING</strong> skills and 2 shoddy skills. Those shoddy skills can be used to replace any missing skill, but the quality will not be there.</p>
        Each shoddy skill used during an application release will give you a <strong>Technical Debt</strong> card. Those cards are useless. They are only here to slow you down since you can draw some from your draw pile.

      <h3 style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1;">Turn Description
      </h3>
      <p>
        At the beginning of your turn, your team draws 4 cards at random from their draw pile.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.	Move
        </p>
        <p>
        The team begins by moving to another desk (they must leave the desk for the other team).<br>
         They will get one <strong>skill</strong> card from the desk they are moving to (TRAINING, CODE_REVIEW, REFACTORING, CODING...).<br>
         If the desk is empty (no more cards), the team will get a <strong>BONUS skill</strong> card instead.
      </p>


        <p>
          2.	Use a skill
        </p>
        <p>Will only appear in later leagues.</p>


      <p>
        3.	Release an application
      </p>
      <p>
        The team can use their available <strong>skills</strong> in hand to <action>RELEASE</action> an application.
         <br>This phase will only appear if you have enough <strong>skills</strong> to do it.
        <br>Don't forget, if you use shoddy skills, you'll receive <strong>Technical Debt</strong> cards!

      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        4.	End of the turn
      </p>
      <p>
        All cards in hand (<strong>skills</strong> and <strong>Technical Debt</strong>) are discarded.
      </p>
    </div>

      <p>
      <h3 style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.1;">  Game end</h3>
      </p>
      <p>
        The hackathon stops as soon as one team releases its 5th application.
        </p><p>Beware, since this hackathon is on the theme of Green IT, the referees will be paying close attention to the quality of the last released application.
         <br>The 5th application of each team cannot be released with shoddy skills!</p>
        <p>When a team has released 5 applications, the game will end once all teams have played the same amount of turns.</p>
        <p>The winner is the team that released the most applications.<br>
        In case of a tie, the winning team will be the one that has the less <strong>Technical Debt</strong> cards.
      </p>
